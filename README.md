# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## W1
### Activity 1
Our advice is that we should understand every code that we are writing and solve every problem that your friend (game tester) tells you.

### Activity 2
1. x=10;
2. x=2;
3. It prints "hello world" in the console every frame after the game starts.
4. MonoBehavior
5. Immediately after the game starts, print "x = 10" in the console.
6. 10 is the argument. "10" assignes the value of 10 to the parameter x. (“x = ” + x) combines a string with an int to be an entire parameter. These determines the input of the method.
7. The bug appears in the line: Transform.Translate(_direction);. Transform here is incorrect. We shouldn't use a class translate.
8. Transform should be changed into _playerTransform
